This article talks about social media as a product sold to the user. It informs the reader on the initial hook of a new app and how it progressively gets the youth more addicted as their time on the internet increases. It accuses large social media platforms of causing the current mental health crisis that is being seen in the youth of the past decade. However, it also acknowledges Covid-19 and how that worsened the crisis. I think it will be useful to my report in that it helps prove that social media is a net negative for society and especially the youth.

This article is about life in the pandemic and how society was online more than ever before. It goes through all the aftermath of this constant internet use and how is impacted our culture and mental well-being. This study will be useful to me because it brings up evidence that constant social media scrolling during the pandemic was linked to causing eating disorders and tic disorders. It will accompany my argument advocating against the overuse of social media and why it should be less addictive. It does happen to give social media some credit attributing it to anxiety mitigation and encouraging an active lifestyle, which I may attempt to rebuke.

Retrieved October 30, 2023 from https://venturebeat.com/mobile/app-makers-its-time-to-stop-exploiting-user-addiction-and-get-ethical/

This article is from a website called Venture Beat which I deem to be a trusted source because of their vast number of sources that come from experts in their field. I intend to use this article to help prove my primary argument in how software developers can prevent addictive using ethics. The article gets to the point of how addiction is a negative and can be prevented through the side of the developers. It also sets a list of ethics that should be followed by all developers. I plan to use this as part of my solution to how developers can prevent social media apps from being addictive and aim to improve society.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/what-is-addiction-2-2017061914490

This article from Harvard Health Publishing informs the reader of addiction. It is primarily about what constitutes an addiction and why they are important. I intend to use the article to help provide a background for the reader on what addiction is and how one can become addicted to social media through the algorithm that is curated specifically for the person that it is being used by. It will also be useful if I decide to compare a social media addiction to another addiction such as gambling or alcohol abuse. I may use a comparison along the lines of alcohol being something that helps an an addict relax and take a load off after a long day.

I will be using this “HowtoGeek” article to learn how to build a free website using GitHub. GitHub is an application that can be used in many ways, but it is primarily used for organization of files and tasks for software development projects. This article will help me unlock a new skill within the world of web development. Assuming I am able to follow along with the guide, I should be able to create a website and put my report onto the website. I will be using this article to aid my attempt to get an A on my final project report.

the Intention to Share towards Information Verification in an Age of Fake News. Retrieved October 30, 2023 from https://doi.org/10.3390/bs12020051. 
This article is about the spread of information within social media platforms specifically in the country of Poland. It highlights the dangers of misinformation especially in cases where politics are the topic at hand. It also completes a case study attempting to better understand fake news in relations to certain recipients using a SmartPL3 software that collected survey results but was deemed inconclusive. The part that I will find most useful is where it raises awareness about misinformation and fake news, so that it can be used to help prove how social media can be a means of spreading false negativity.

Use of Online Technologies. Retrieved October 30, 2023 https://doi.org/10.1111/cdev.13532.
This article recognizes the risks that are taken inherently by a user as soon as the internet is on. Whether it is on your phone or on a laptop, information is being given away in massive quantities on a daily basis. It talks about precautions that should be taken when using an electronic device online. I intend to use this article as a way to inform the reader of the current ways that are needed prevent the misuse of information taken by developers with poor ethics. It will also tie into my introduction into the topic of users needing to protect oneself on social media.

This study will be used to help get across the point that social media is a net loss for the youth. The article gives examples of factors that may be influenced by constant social media habits in young adults. One of the factors mentioned is how social media can cause loss of quality sleep and even less sleep all together. The quality of sleep is from phone usage before bed. It is recommended that phone screens are not on for at least 30 minutes before bed. Another factor mentioned is that social media gives people another reason to fear missing out, causing them to be on the app more often.
